Stochastic Weighting Averaging (SWA) applied to simulation-based inference in cosmology. 

The code has two example: 

- CMB - Application to "simulations" of CMB temperature power spectra, as shown in our ML4Astro ICML 2022 workshop paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08435)
- simbig - Application to the SIMulation-Based Inference of Galaxies (SIMBIG) (https://ml4astro.github.io/icml2022/assets/24.pdf). These simulations will become public in the next few months

It should be relatively straightforward to create new examples.
